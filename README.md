# Distance Calculation and Visualization

This project involves generating a dataset of point pairs and their distances, and then visualizing the distribution of these distances using a histogram.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- A C compiler (such as `gcc`) to compile the distance generation program.
- Python with `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries for running the visualization script.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

#### Compiling the C Program

Navigate to the directory containing the `generate_viz.c` file and run:

```bash
gcc -o generate_viz -lm generate_viz.c



```
The code and the documentation were created with ChatGBT (GBT-4). The author has tested, arranged the code, and made it public.
